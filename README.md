## How It Works

The Crypto Arbitrage Tracker works by continuously polling the APIs of Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Hereâ€™s a simplified breakdown of the process:

1. **API Integration**: The application connects to each exchange's API to retrieve current price data.
2. **Data Comparison**: It compares the prices of the same cryptocurrency across the different exchanges.
3. **Arbitrage Detection**: When it finds a significant price difference, it calculates potential profit margins.
4. **User Notification**: The application sends alerts to the user, informing them of potential trading opportunities.

### Example of Arbitrage Detection

Letâ€™s say the price of Bitcoin (BTC) is as follows:

- **Binance**: $40,000
- **Coinbase**: $40,500
- **Kraken**: $40,300

The tracker will identify that there is an opportunity to buy BTC on Binance and sell it on Coinbase for a profit.
